# Some coding projects I've been working on related to the game Town of Salem 2
### Leaderboard Bot
- discord.py, google apps script for google sheets
- send out Google Forms for players to submit their ranked scores
- admin can quickly verify screenshots via Google Sheets
- automatically compile responses and set up weekly leaderboard
- post to server and distribute rewards!
### Scorekeeper Mod <- you guys can use this!
- post-game collect results and post them to text files
- parse text files to database for keeping game records or *analyzing winrates of individual players or roles* (not started, but would like to + this is really easy to implement in theory) 
- Scorekeeper runs on Salem Mod Loader. Go to Scorekeeper -> bin -> Scorekeeper.dll, and paste that file into your Salem Mod Loader -> Mods directory.

*Most files are not intended for outside use and likely will not function (I've omitted the configuration files). They are merely there to serve as proof of my work*
